Thomas Parke d’invilliers I've been turning over my father in my younger and more vulnerable years. my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over. in my mind, \"when you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he said. \"just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had,\" he said. he said, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had\" at has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. most of the confidences were unsought—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—freq—fre the intimate revelations of young men are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. d of missing something if I forget that a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes. only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. if personality is an unbroke personality is an unbroke. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability that is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”. n series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life. inary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person. it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in wake of his dreams. it is what preyed on Gatsby. my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. the Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch. the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War. d the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. I graduated from new Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father. a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great war. the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe. everybody I knew was in the bond business. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a single man. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought. the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season. a young man at the office sat at the office and sat at the office. uggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month. at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and went out to the country alone. it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man stopped me on the road. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he casually conferred on me the freed. a dozen volumes on banking and credit a bank and credit a bank. a dozen volumes on banking and credit a bank and credit a bank and credit a bank and credit a bank and credit a bank. nd investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. nd investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets. it was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due to its riotous nature. a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere. they are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbu, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. to the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. to the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. the one on my right was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of thin beard. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore. it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water and a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn. the history of the summer begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new Haven. he was one of those men who reached such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. his family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d leff. t Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away. he brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. they had spent a year in France for no particular reason. it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom I scarcelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll the lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile. it ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens. the front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon. he had changed since his new Haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. lished dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. he seemed to fill those boots until he strained the top lacing. a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. a gruff husky tenor, a gruff husky tenor, adds to the impression of fractiousness. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked. he seemed to say, \"just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are\" we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. he moved a broad flat hand along the fron. he said he wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness. a half acre of deep, pungent roses and a motorboat bumped the tide offshore. we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows. windows were ajar and gleaming white against fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling. ely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless. with her chin raised a little, she was balancing something. the other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise. she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh and came forw. the other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise. she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly. she quickly tipped her head back again. a sort of apology arose to my lips. ciency draws a stunned tribute from me. ciency was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down. there was an excitement in her face, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth. a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since. a dozen people had sent their love through me. the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath. \"how gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” she added irrelevantly: \"You ought to see the baby\" \"you will if you stay in the East,\" he said. \"you will if you stay in the East,\" he said. \"you will if you stay in the East,\" he said. the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. she yawned and with a series of yawns. she yawned and yawned. Daisy retorted: \"i've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember\" \"no, thanks,\" said miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. miss Baker was a slender, small-breasted girl with an erect carriage. her grey eyes lucked her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Daisy ooked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. \"you must know Gatsby,\" she remarked contemptuously. two young women preceded us on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset. four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch. the longest day in the year will be in two weeks. \"i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it,\" yawned miss Baker. \"what’ll we plan?\" said Daisy. \"you did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"you did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"you did it, Tom,\" she said. Daisy and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter. sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close. \"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently. \"you make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" he confessed on his second glass of corky. if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. \"he reads deep books with long words in them,\" insisted Tom. \"it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things,\" she whispered. king ferociously toward the fervent sun. \"you ought to live in California—\" began Miss Baker. he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. h, science and art, and all that pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me. butler used to be silver polisher for some people in new york. he had to polish it from morning till night, until it began to affect his nose. \"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggests. miss Baker's voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened. the butler came back and ms Baker had to give up his position. the butler came back and ms Baker had to give up his position. urmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. she turned to miss Baker for confirmation: \"An absolute rose?\" is was untrue. she was extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her. suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. \"you mean to say you don’t know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. \"you mean to say you don’t know?\" said Miss Baker hesitantly. she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Tom and Daisy looked outdoors for a minute, and it's very romantic outdoors. she sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me. she continued: \"there's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a bird\" the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables. the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Tom shook her head decisively. miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able to put this fift into air. she was able utterly to put this fift fift into the air. the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. they strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body. the horses, with several feet of twilight between them, were not mentioned again. g to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. she took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. \"we don’t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"you didn’t come to my wedding,\" \"you didn’t come to my wedding.\" \"that’s true,\" she hesitated. \"it’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things,\" she said. \"it’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things,\" she said. nurse turned her head away and wept and asked if it was a boy or a girl. she told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. \"you see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,\" she said. her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s. the instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she thought. it made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society. the lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flu. the lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper. tter of slender muscles in her arms held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee. rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot Springs and Palm Beach. rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot Springs and Palm Beach. rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot Springs and Palm Beach. \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\" \"Of course you will,\" said Daisy. \"in fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together,\" she said. \"they oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way,\" said Daisy. \"they oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way,\" she asked. \"who oughtn’t to?\" asked Daisy coldly. Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence. \"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\" asked Daisy. \"don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he told me. they came to the door with me and stood side by side with me. they stood side by side with me and stood side by side. \"I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"we heard that you were engaged to a girl out west,\" insisted Daisy. gossip had published the banns. the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. the banns were rumoured to be rumoured into marriage. it seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house. but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. the fact that he had some woman in New York was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. car ran under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. it was a summer summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages. wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. the silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turned my head to watch it. h his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars suggest that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens. h his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. when I looked once again for Gatsby he had vanished, he had vanished. ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque garden. ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque garden. ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills. ash-grey men move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cl. the eyes of doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. they look out of no face, but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass through it. the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, a small foul river. the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, a small foul river. passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. his acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popu. ash-heaps jumped to his feet and forced me from the car. ash-heaps jumped to his feet and took hold of my elbow. \"we're getting off,\" he insisted. nt you to meet my girl\" was the only building in san francisco. nt you to meet my girl was the only building in san francisco. ight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land. one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant. the third was a garage. nterior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. nterior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. naemic, and faintly handsome, says old man. \"how’s business?\" he says. \"when are you going to sell me that car?\" he says. Wilson says if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all. \"i just meant—\" his voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty. there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled ecstasy. a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair. \"get on the next train,\" says his wife, who moved close to him. she nodded and moved away from him just as he emerged with two chairs from his office door. it was a few days before the Fou. a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes along the railroad track. \"it does her good to get away,\" said Tom Buchanan, exchanging a frown with doctor Eckleburg. she changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her hips. at the newsstand she bought a copy of tow tow. in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery. in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. a grey old man cowered a dozen puppies of an indeterminate breed. he bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. \"what kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eaning forward. the man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck. \"no, it’s not exactly a police dog,\" said the man with disappointment. the airedale was undoubtedly there was an Airedale concc. \"that dog will cost you ten dollars,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"it’s more of an Airedale,\" he passed his hand over the washrag of a back. we drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft. we drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft. we drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft. we drove over to Fifth Avenue. myrtle will be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. she’ll call her sister Catherine. she’s said to be very beautiously beautiating. at 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and other purchases, and went haughtily in. the apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. the living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it. the only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. some old copies of town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter. a reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk. he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits. a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door. a dim, hazy cast over the apartment, so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it. after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter. as Tom and Myrtle reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. the sister, Catherine, was a slender, world-class drinker. ly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration gave a blurred air to her face. she laughed immoderately, repeated her question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel. he had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekben. his wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. she told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hunch. she told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hunch. dred and twenty-seven times since they had been married. Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before. she was now dressed in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon. her personality had also undergone a change. \"most of these fellas will cheat you every time,\" she told her sister in a high, mincing shout. \"most of these fellas will cheat you every time,\" she said. \"what was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. Wilson. \"i think it’s adorable,\" she remarked. she rejected the compliment by raising money for her dress. we all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and lone hair from over her eyes. \"if Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it,\" she said. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side. he then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face. \"i wouldn’t think of changing the light,\" cried Mrs. McKee. Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. she looked at me and laughed pointlessly. she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen. a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. the sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. \"i live next door to him,\" she inquired. \"i live next door to him,\" she inquired. absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine. she only nodded in a b b b b. \"Ask Myrtle,\" said Tom, breaking into a shout of laughter. \"you’ll give McKee a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?\" she asked. Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: \"Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to\" she looked at myrtle and then at Tom. the answer to this was unexpected. it came from myrtle, who had overheard the question. it was violent and obscene. she lowered her voice again. \"when they do get married, they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over,\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"i just got back from a divorce,\" she exclaimed surprisingly. the late afternoon saturday saturday saturday. we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. we had an awful time getting back in the private rooms. ky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean. \"i almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"i almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me!'

Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.

Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. gypsies, in trembling opal, seize a cocktail out of the air, dump it down for courage. gypsies weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group. the party has begun. on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house. I was one of the few guests who had actually blasted. the party has begun. people were not invited—they went there. they got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island. sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all. a chauffeur in a uniform of robin's-egg blue crossed my lawn early that morning. the honour would be entirely Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his party that night. Jay Gatsby tended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it. I wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know. the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. scott mccartney: i was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. mccartney: i was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. oon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way. the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements. Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps. she stood at the head of the steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden. \"i thought you might be here,\" she replied absently as I came up. she held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute. the girls had lost in the finals the week before. \"you don’t know who we are,\" said one of the girls in yellow. \"you’ve dyed your hair since then,\" remarked one of the girls in yellow. a tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight. we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men. the last one was the one I met you at. nswered the girl, in an alert confident voice, in an alert voice. she turned to her companion: \"Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?\" \"i like to come,\" Lucille said. \"there’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,\" says the other girl eagerly. \"he doesn’t want any trouble with anybody,\" she asks. omebody told me they thought he killed a man once. one of the men nodded in confirmation. one of the men nodded in confirmation. one of the men nodded in confirmation. a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany. she narrowed her eloquent eloquently to narrow her eloquent eloquently. we all turned and looked around for Gatsby. it was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired. the first supper was now being served, and she invited me to join her own party. the party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the fuendo. the party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the fuendo. nction of representing the staid nobility of the countryside. \"Let’s get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour. she explained that we were going to find the host. g me uneasy undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way. she couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the veranda. on a chance we tried an important-looking door. a stout, middle-aged man was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table. he waved his hand toward the bookshelves. he waved his hand toward the bookshelves. he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the Stoddard Lectu. he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the Stoddard Lectu. res. \"see!\" cried triumphantly. \"it fooled me.

Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering. \"i was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he continued. \"i was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,\" he said. old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles. old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles. old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles. by midnight the hilarity had increased. a celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz. between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden. the moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn. we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl. at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. we talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in france. he told me that he had just bought a hydro hydro. he said he was in the twenty-eighth Infantry. \"what time?\" \"any time that suits you best,\" she asked. \"this is an unusual party for me.

And what does he do?\" she answered with a wan smile. \"he told me once he was an Oxford mammal,\" she replied. a dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away. \"however, I don’t believe it,\" she insisted, \"why not?\" \"i just don’t think he went there\" young men didn't drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. \"he gives large parties,\" says Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. e parties are so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy. there was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden. he smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed. \"the piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the world!’. thursday's fraternal hilarity increased when thursday's fraternal hilarity increased. thursday's fraternal hilarity increased as thursday's fraternal hilarity increased. girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way. girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups. no french bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder. gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us. \"miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"i beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone\" Eluding Jordan's undergraduate was engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two cctv stars. she was engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two cctv personalities. horus girls, and who implored me to join him, went inside. one of the girls in yellow was playing the piano. beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus. she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very, very sad. the tears coursed down her cheeks when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes. they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. one of the men tried to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way. he broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks. the reluctance to go home was not confined to waynified way. the hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. the wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices. \"we’re almost the last tonight,\" said ward men. the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility ended in a short struggle. the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night. both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night. t the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye. t the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him. but I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you. \"Please come and see me...

Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” “Good night.” he smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance. headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. in the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coupé. a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road. a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, adding to the already violent confusion of the scene. king from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way. \"how’d it happen?\" he shrugged his shoulders. if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night. \"but I wasn’t even trying,\" he explained indignantly. if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night. an awed hush fell upon the bystanders as the coupé swung slowly open. \"you’re lucky it was just a wheel! a bad driver and not even trying!\" the criminal said. blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment blundering. the apparition stood swaying for a moment blundering for a moment. efore efore viewed the man in the duster. \"Wha’s matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"did we run outa gas?\" he asked. at least a dozen men, some a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond. “But the wheel’s off!” he hesitated after a moment. the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. a wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endo. three nights apart were merely casual eponymous. eponymous events were merely casual eponymous. eponymous events were merely casual. clerks and bond-salesmen lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on liams. they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs. they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs. ttle pig sausages, mashed potatoes and coffee. she even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City. when she went on her vacation in July she let it blow quietly away. rioters came to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station. i liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd. in a few minutes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners. in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners. enchanted metropolitan twilight felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others. young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner wasted the most poignant moments of night. the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs. voices sang, and unheard jokes made unintelligible circles inside. lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. ty and sharing their intimate excitement, wished them well. the bored haughty face that she turned to thailand's thailand's thailand's thailand. e world concealed something, even though they don’t in the beginning. when we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down. suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. a caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. the incident and the name had remained together in my mind. tively avoided clever, shrewd men and avoided clever, shrewd men. she was incurably dishonest and was not able to endure being at a disadvantage. she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young. fender flicked a button on one man's coat on one man's coat. she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man's coat. \"you’re a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man,\" she says. ea rotten driver, ea rotten driver, protested. \"either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.\" \"no, you’re not,\" she said lightly. interior rules act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. \"i hate careless people.

I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. with fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astori. \"all right, old sport,\" called Gatsby, waved it before the man's eyes. he waved it before the man's eyes, tipping his cap. \"all right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. the city grew up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. the city swam across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish. een from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time. a dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. in a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar, I met Gatsby for lunch. my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man. \"this is my friend Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. a small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. he raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril.

Daisy called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea. the day agreed upon was pouring into the house. the day agreed upon was pouring into the house. a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. this reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so drove into west egg village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys. a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. he was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes. the grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean. \"what grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. he took him into the pantry, wheezing. the rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. re he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. the Finnish economist shook the kitchen floor as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. he looked at his watch as if there was some invisible but alarming happenings outside. a large open car was coming up the drive under the dripping bare lilac-trees. a large open car was coming up the drive. \"don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four,\" he said. Daisy's face looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile. her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. a damp streak of hair lay like a dreadful dread. ash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car. ash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car. e gasoline affects his nose? \"why?\" she said innocently. \"well, that’s funny,\" she said innocently. \"what’s funny?\" she turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking. a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes. with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall. he turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living-room. gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. he was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. dom leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock. his eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand. he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin. the automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. \"we haven’t met for many years,\" said Daisy. \"we haven’t met for many years,\" she said. the demoniac Finn brought tea in on a tray. Daisy and I looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse. \"where are you going?\" asked Gatsby in immediate alarm. \"i’ve got to speak to you about something before you go,\" he whispered. \"this is a terrible mistake,\" he said. ide: \"you’re just embarrassed, that’s all\" \"you’re just embarrassed, that’s all,\" he said. \"you’re acting like a little boy,\" he said incredulously. gatsby had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before. he ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. his irregular lawn was pouring and my irregular lawn was well-shaved. gardener abounded in small swamps and prehistoric marshes. brewer had built it early in the ‘period’ craze, a decade before. he agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all neighbouring cottages if the own cottages. er's children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. he went into an immediate decline. his children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. a maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each. he spat meditatively into the garden. it seemed like the murmur of their voices. in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too. they were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air. mbarrassment was gone. he literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room. he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light. \"what do you think of that? It’s stopped raining,\" she said. \"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said. \"you’re sure you want me to come?\" \"Absolutely, old sport.\" \"my house looks well, doesn’t it?\" he said. \"it took me just three years to earn the money that bought it,\" he said. \"i lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war,\" he said. when asked what business he was in he answered: \"That’s my affair,\" before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply. he looked at me with more attention. \"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. people who do interesting things. people who do interesting things. Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky. she admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms. e steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. as we wander through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table. a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. we went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk. we went upstairs, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms. he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from Daisy. he hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response. the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. his bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair. gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. he had passed through two states and was entering upon a third. after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder. he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his suits and dressing-gowns and ties. he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel lost folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolk. ls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange. with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. \"they’re such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. it had seemed as close to her, almost touching her. e moon's count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. a large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me. the name sounded faintly familiar. \"you never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht,\" says Daisy. \"he’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago,\" says Daisy. the rubies stood side by side examining it. they stood side by side examining it. they stood side by side examining it, and Gatsby took up the receiver. w. the rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west. there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. perhaps my presence made them feel satisfactorily more satisfactorial. \"we'll have Klipspringer play the piano,\" says Gatsby. he returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man. now decently clothed in a \"sport shirt,\" open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers. he flipped a swiping swiping swiping swiping. he flipped a swiping swiping swiping swiping. the grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light. in the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. he lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match. all the lights were going on in west egg now; the elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena elena ctric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from new york. the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's fa. a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. he had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all. he had thrown himself into it with a creative passion. a man can store up in his ghostly heart with no fire or freshness. he adjusted himself a little, visibly, and turned toward her with a rush of emotion. he says that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, frightened, frightened voice. Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one morning at Gatsby's door. he asked him if he had anything to say about what. it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office. ldn's ldn's ldn didn't reveal or didn't fully understand. ldn's notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality. the inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of north Dakota. he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. he changed his name at the age of seventeen. he saw his yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake Superior. it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat. Jay Gatsby of west egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of farm people. he sprang from his Platonic conception of farm people. his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people. he invented the kind of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would likely invent. he had been beating his way along the south. for over a year he had been beating his way along the south. his brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. he knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant. a universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain. the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his clothes upon the floor. each night he added to tangled clothes. the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing. an instinct toward his future glory had led him to the small Luis de luzerne. the rock of the world was founded on a fairy’s wing. theran college of St. Olaf's in southern Minnesota stayed there two weeks. he drifted back to lake Superior, and was still searching for something to do. cody was a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. the transactions in Montana found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness. an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. tions by which she played Madame de Maintenon were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902. he had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay. resented all the beauty and glamour in the world. at any rate he asked a few questions and found that people liked him. he bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers and a ya. Dan Cody was steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor. he provided for contingencies by reposing more and more trust in him. he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in him. the arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died. se of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. it was indirectly due to Cody that drank so little. it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollies. he never understood the legal device that was used against him. but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. the vague contour of Jay Gatsby filled out to the substantiality of a man. he told me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. so I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away. t was a halt in my association with his affairs. for several weeks, I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone. but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. tom and a man named Sloane were a party of three on horseback. they were a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit. they were a party of three on horseback. he was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. but he would be uneasy until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. \"we did. I remember very well,\" said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. \"you were with Nick here,\" Gatsby said, almost aggressively. \"you live near here, Nick?\" \"Next door.\" \"That so?\" Tom turned to me, almost aggressively. e'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby. \"be ver’ nice,\" said Mr. Sloane. \"please don’t hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. \"you come to supper with me,\" said the lady enthusiastically. \"you come to supper with me,\" said the lady enthusiastically. \"you come to supper with me,\" said the lady enthusiastically. \"we won’t be late if we start now,\" says Sloane. \"we won’t be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud. \"my God, I believe the man’s coming,\" says Tom. \"She says she does want him,\" he frowned. \"i wonder where in the devil he met Daisy,\" he frowned. women run around too much these days to suit me. Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses. they trotted quickly down the driving driving driving. e was perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. he was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone. perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness. there were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion. but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept west egg as a world complete in itself. it is saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment. it is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment. if you want to kiss me any time during the evening, just let me know. \"look around. You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about,\" she whispered. \"Perhaps you know that lady,\" he said of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. \"i was just thinking I don’t know a soul here,\" he said. the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the polo player\" for the rest of the evening. \"the man bending over her is her director,\" says Daisy. \"i liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose,\" Daisy says. \"i'd rather look at all these famous people in—in—in—in oblivion,\" says Tom pleasantly. tory foxtrot appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. foxtrot: \"if there’s a fire or a flood, or any act of God\" Daisy looked around after a moment and told her she wasn't having a good time. she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty\" the girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. at this inquiry she opened her eyes and opened her eyes. the girl had been urging dais to step down. she was septic on the air. y to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow. y to play golf with her at the local club. the accused hollowly affirmed the accused hollowly. 'there’s somebody that needs your help, Doc' \"anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss Baedeker. \"they almost drown me once over in New Jersey,\" mumbled doctor Civet. the moving-picture director and his star were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. it occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this plum. west egg appalled by its raw vigour that chafed undisclosed undisclosed. she was appalled by its raw vigour that chafed undisclosed. the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. sa shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow. \"who is this Gatsby anyhow?\" asked Tom suddenly. \"a lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.\" a breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar. \"you didn’t look so interested,\" she said with an effort. \"you didn’t look so interested,\" she said. Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper. when the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly. each change tip has a meaning in each word that it had never had before. \"Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,\" she said suddenly. \"he owned some drugs and he owned some drugs,\" she said. \"i think I’ll make a point of finding out,\" she said. a dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. ties totally absent from her world? what would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? perhaps some incredible guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who would blot out those five ties. tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face. his eyes were drawn unusually tight on his face. his eyes were drawn unusually tight on his face. \"She didn’t like it,\" he said immediately. \"Of course she did,\" he said. \"I feel far away from her,\" he said. Daisy had obliterated four years with that sentence. after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house. after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house. ive years ago broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers. \"you can’t repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. the past was lurking in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. he talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something that had gone into loving Daisy. one autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. they stopped here and turned toward a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. he saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees. t, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. his heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. he knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. ning-fork was struck upon a star and kissed her. she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something. his lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night. trimalchio's career as trimalchio was over. he squinted at me suspiciously from the door. after a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory dilatory. my Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago. he replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into west egg village to blunder. e bribed by tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. the grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty. the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren't servants at all. the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. the next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. the next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. the national Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. the woman next to me perspired delicately into her white shirtwaist. her pocketbook slapped to the floor with a desolate cry. \"Oh, my!\" she gasped. she handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners. \"some weather!... hot!... Hot!... Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot enough for you? commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me. the receiver came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our straw hats. he set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats. the room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh. \"the rumour is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.\" \"the rumour is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.\" cynically, he flung open the door, blocked out its doors. he flung open the door, blocked out its doors. he flung open the door, blocked out its doors. \"mr. Gatsby!\" hurried into the room with his thick body. he put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. \"make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy. e's a lady present,\" says e's a lady present. she looked around doubtfully. \"you kiss Nick too.\" \"what a low, vulgar girl!\" cried Daisy. the child rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress. the nurse relinquished the child by the nurse. he kept looking at the child with surprise. \"you dream, you. you absolute little dream,\" says the child. \"you dream, you. you absolute little dream,\" says the child calmly. \"you got on a white dress too,\" says the child. Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. she looked like her father, but she looked like her. the nurse took a step forward and held out her hand. we drank in long, greedy swallows. we drank in long, greedy swallows. we drank in long, greedy swallows. a small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea on the green Sound. the sun’s getting colder every year. the sun’s getting colder every year. abounding blessed isles and scalloped ocean. \"there’s sport for you,\" says the boat's owner. \"there’s sport for you,\" says the boat's owner. we had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale. we had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale. sted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!\" her voice struggled through the heat, beating against it. \"who wants to go to town?\" Daisy demanded. her eyes floated toward her. she cried, “you look so cool.” her eyes met, and they stared together at each other. she had told him that she loved him, and she had told him that she loved him. \"you know the advertisement of the man,\" he broke in. he got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. \"come on!” his temper cracked. \"what’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start,\" he said. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. she objected. a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. \"i don’t see the idea of going to town,\" aced Tom savagely. \"shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window. atsby's voice is full of money, he said suddenly. \"her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly. the cymbals' song of it rose and fell in it. king's daughter, the golden girl, came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth. he felt the hot, green leather of the seat. \"you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town,\" he objected. a pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at the gauge and looked at the gauge. \"come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's car. \"you take Nick and Jordan. We’ll take you in this circus wagon,\" said Tom. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car. we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind. he looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known. the immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss. the immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss. \"i could have gone deed deed deed deed, don’t you?\" he said. \"a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously. \"About Gatsby! no, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past,\" he said. nk suit snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like that\" snorted Jordan crossly. \"daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!\" \"we’ve got enough to get us to town,\" says doctor T. J. Eckleburg. \"there’s a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"i don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat,\" he said. t the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. \"Let’s have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"you sounded well enough on the phone,\" he demanded. Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and unscrewed the cap of the tank. in the sunlight his face was green. \"how do you like this one?\" asked Tom. ne,\" says Wilson, as he strained at the handle. \"Like to buy it?\" \"Big chance,\" says Wilson. \"my wife and I want to go west,\" exclaimed Tom. the coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand. the coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and a waving hand. he had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world. the shock had made him physically sick. he had made a paral. there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty, as if he had just got some poor girl with child. ality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon. over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil. after a moment, I perceived that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. Myrtle Wilson had no consciousness of being observed. her expression was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces. on myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purpose of being observed. there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. his wife and his mistress, who he took to be his wife, took him to be his wife. instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind. we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé. the word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom. before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop. a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us as a truck gave out a cursing whistle. \"we can’t argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently. several times he turned his head and looked back for their car. if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. the notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths. we then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint j. the room was large and stifling, and opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. \"the thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" says Tom impatiently. \"you make it ten times worse by crabbing about it,\" he says. \"you’re the one that wanted to come to town,\" remarked Gatsby. the telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor. no one laughed, but Gatsby examined the parted string. Daisy threw the book on a chair as Tom threw the book on a chair. he threw the book on a chair, and tossed it on a chair. the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March. \"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee. he stayed three weeks until Daddy told him he had to get out, the day after he left Daddy died. a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. \"we’re getting old,\" says Daisy. \"if we were young we’d rise and dance,\" says her. \"he was a friend of Daisy's,\" she denies. asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him. Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly. a waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his \"thank you\" and the soft closing october. the waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice. gatsby was in nineteen-nineteen, he only stayed five months. he glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. Daisy rose went to the table, smiling faintly, and went to the table. she ordered, \"and I’ll make you a mint julep.\" \"we could go to any of the universities in England or France,\" she said. em so stupid to yourself... Look at the mint! \"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.\" \"He isn’t causing a row,\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. people start by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. people start by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage. ed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. \"we’re all white here,\" murmured Jordan. he was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. the transition from libertine to prig was so complete. the transition from libertine to prig was so complete. the transition from libertine to prig was complete. Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement. \"you must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically. \"you must be crazy!\" exclaimed Gatsby. Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain. neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions. y. \"Going on for five years—and you didn’t know\" Tom turned to Daisy sharply. \"you’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?\" \"not seeing,\" said Daisy. she loved me when she married me and she loves her. she loves me when she married me and she loves her. she loves me when she married me and she loves her. \"no,\" says Gatsby, shaking his head. \"sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing,\" he nodded sagely. \"you’re revolting,\" said Daisy. \"daisy, that’s all over now,\" says gatsby. \"you never loved him,\" says gatsby. \"you never loved him,\" he says. \"you never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible relucta. \"i never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible relucta. \"i never loved him,\" she said. nce. \"not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly. \"No\" from the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air. \"not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?\" there was a husky tenderness in his tone. she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet. she began to sob helplessly. she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet. \"even that’s a lie,\" says Tom savagely. \"there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things neither of us can ever forget,\" she says. \"Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on,\" said Tom. \"you don’t understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. rol himself now: \"why’s that?\" \"Daisy’s leaving you,\" \"nonsense.\" \"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort. \"i won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. Meyer Wolfshiem and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores he bought up. \"you can suit yourself about that, old sport,\" said Gatsby steadily. re and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. \"what about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"you let him go to jail for a month over in new jersey,\" he said. Walter came to us dead broke. he was very glad to pick up some money, old sport. \"Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. i glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband. I turned back to Gatsby and was startled at his expression. n all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden passed. he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave up. nly the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away. nly the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away. the voice begged again to go. \"Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realize that his presumptuous little flirtation is over\" they were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity. it was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for long Island. he talked incessantly, exulting incessantly, exulting incessantly, exulting. human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. Jordan beside me, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. as we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand. the young Greek was the principal witness at the inquest. he had slept through the heat until after five when he found him sick in his office. he refused to go to bed, but he refuses to go to bed. a violent racket broke out overhead while his neighbour was trying to persuade him. his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead. the neighbours had been neighbours for four years. when he wasn't working, he stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. when anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. n wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor. he asked him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. but he didn’t, he supposed he forgot to. she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting before he could move from his door the business was over. she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting. h car came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and disappeared around the next bend. the other car came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where myrtle Wils was. the mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corny corny. she mingled her thick dark blood with the dust and knelt in the road. the mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corny. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away. \"that’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last,\" he said. a hollow, wailing sound issued incessantly from the garage door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. mr. \"there’s some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly. he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage. he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through. e closed up again with a murmur of expostulation. new arrivals deranged the line, and new arrivals deranged the line. myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in a blanket, lay on a worktable by the wall. a motorcycle policeman took down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. he stood on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. his eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall. he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call: \"Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\" Presently Tom lifted his head wit. h a jerk addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman. \"m-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—” “no, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—” muttered Tom fiercely. \"there was two cars,\" said policeman, \"one comin’, one goin’, see?\" the policeman asked the policeman keenly, \"one goin’ each way. well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and felled. a pale well-dressed negro stepped near the scene. he said the car passed him down the robbing robbing robbing. a new theme found voice among his grasping cries: \"you don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! ad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat under his coat. he seized him firmly by the upper arms. \"you’ve got to pull yourself together,\" he said. policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes. \"what’s all that? I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about,\" he said. policeman says he knows the car that did it... it was a yellow car. \"we’ve come straight from New York,\" says someone who had been driving a little behind us. the policeman turned away after picking up Wilson like a doll. \"if somebody’ll come here and sit with him,\" he snapped authoritatively. the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. as he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let’s get out\" as he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let’s get out\" as he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let’s get out\" the coupé raced through the night through the dark rustling teeming teeming. the house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling teeming teeming teeming. a change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. as we walked across tuesday he looked up at the second floor. \"there’s nothing we can do tonight,\" he said. he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases. \"i’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper,\" he opened the door. \"won’t you come in, Nick?\" \"no, thanks,\" she said. she turned abruptly away and ran up the stairs. she said she was a little sick and wanted to be alone. porch steps into the house, butler calls a taxi. the butler's voice calls a taxi, butler's voice calls a taxi. thai slams thai and thai. \"what are you doing?\" he asked. \"just standing here, old sport,\" he was behind him in the dark shrubbery. he was robbed of the house in a moment. he was in the dark shrubbery. y. \"did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute. \"Was she killed?\" \"Yes.\" \"I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once,\" he said. \"who was the woman?\" he asked. \"how the devil did it happen?\" he broke off. \"Was Daisy drivin drivin drivin? \" g?\" \"yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I was.\" when we left New York she was very nervous and thought it would steady her to drive. first Daisy turned away from us, thought we were somebody she knew. the woman lost her nerve and turned back. she fell over into her lap and I drove on. she fell over into my lap and she fell over into my lap. she was driving on, but she was unable to stop. \"he won’t touch her,\" he said. \"he won’t touch her,\" he said. \"how long are you go, old sport,\" he said. a new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. he might think anything; he might think anything. \"you wait here,\" he said. drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. the blind was drawn from the pantry window. the blind was drawn from the pantry window. the blind was drawn from the pantry window. Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table. he was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand fell upon and covered her own. once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement. there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture. there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture. there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture. \"you’d better come home and get some sleep,\" he asked anxiously. he put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house. he walked away and left him standing there. a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage dreams. I jumped out of bed and began to dress. his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall. \"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. his house had never seemed so enormous to him. the rooms were musty, as though they hadn't been aired for many years. there was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere. there was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty. \"you ought to go away now, old sport?\" \"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal\" \"you ought to go away now, old sport?\" \"you ought to go away now, old sport?\" \"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal\" it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody. \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice. she was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. it amazed him—he had never been in such a beau. there was a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms. there was a hint of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors. there was a hint of romances that were not musty and laid away already. he felt his presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions. but he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a. a. Jay Gatsby was a penniless young man without a past. he took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously. he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to tuck. he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself. he had no such facilities—he had no such facilities. he had no such facilities—he had no such facilities. he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world. but he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. she vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby. when they met again, it was her breathless, who was betrayed. her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine. david cameron: he kissed her curious mouth and kissed her. she had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever. she was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves. \"i can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport\" she thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. she thought I knew a lot because she was in love with me too. the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. he afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory. they had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another. they had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another. he was a captain before he went to the front. after the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras. she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all. the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues”. at the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever. fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petal. Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men. suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress. she wanted her life shaped now, immediately, and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand. that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. the letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford. the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. \"you must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon,\" says gatsby. \"you must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon,\" says gatsby. cnn's john mccarthy is the author of the affair. cnn's john mccarthy is the author of the affair. mccarthy is the author of the affair with cnn. he came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip. he made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. he walked the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night. s Daisy's house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself was pervaded with a melancholy beauty. he left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. lding-chair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street. anishing city where she had drawn her breath. he stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air. but it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it. the gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps. he turned to me apologetica. he said: \"don’t do it today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves will start falling pretty soon. \"you know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?\" I looked at my watch and stood up. I didn’t want to leave Gatsby; I missed that train before I could get myself away. \"I suppose Daisy’ll call you about noon,\" we walked slowly down the steps. \"well, goodbye,\" we shook hands and I started away. \"they’re a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. a rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the whitish whitney. his pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the whitney. e steps, a native of california, was a corrupted man. he stood on those steps, concealing his dream. \"goodbye,\" he calked for his hospitality. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. the phone woke me, and I started sweat breaking out on my forehead. she often called me up at this hoarding hoard. her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window. this morning it seemed harsh and dry. \"I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going do do it,\" she said. the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid. \"How could it have mattered then?\" Silence for a moment. \"Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\" \"no—I don’t think this afternoon,\" \"Very well.\" \"It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—\" We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day. a central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. a central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. a central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance. ash-heaps crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. myrtle Wilson's tragic achievememe became less real even to him and he could tell it no longer. myrtle's tragic achievememe was a tragic achievement. nt was forgotten after we left there the night before. she must have broken her rule against drinking that night. when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. someone took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister's body. a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. ame into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. he had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer. after that, he stayed there alone wit. h Wilson grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen. but when he heard himself say tuesday he heard himself say tuesday. \"how long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question?\" \"ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any childrr? the hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light. when Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped. the work bench was stained where the body had been lying. \"you ought to have a church, George, for times like this. you must have gone to chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chutney, chu the effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking. the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes. \"look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk. the hat drawer was made of leather and braided silver. it was made of leather and braided silver. it was apparently new, but it was apparently new. conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from myrtle. his comforter left several explanations in the air. \"then he killed her,\" he said. Wilson shook his head. his eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly. \"you’re morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"you’re morbid, George,\" said his friend. the man in that car ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop. he believed that Mrs. Wilson had bragged that she had bragged about her. \"how could she of been like that?\" says Wilson. \"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?\" he was almost sure that he could telephone for a friend. glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and teeming here and teeming. \"you may fool me, but you can’t fool God!' he muttered after a long silence. \"i told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool me,\" he muttered. doctor T. J. Eckleburg had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night. he stood there a long time, his face close tucked away from the window. by six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together. nd Michaelis awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage. his movements were traced to port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill. he bought a sandwich that he didn't eat, and a cup of coffee. he disappeared from view for three hours. the police said he had a way of finding out. he said he had a way of finding out. he disappeared from view for three hours. garage man was in west egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house. by half-past two he knew Gatsby's name. by that time he knew Gatsby's name. his bathing-suit left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances. the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock. he waited for it until four o’clock until there was anyone to give it. if that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world. he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is. a new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts drifted fortuitously about like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees. the chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything. om the station directly to Gatsby's house was the first thing that alarmed anyone. four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool. there was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain. a gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. the touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water. gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. a rope stretched across the front door of the gardener's house. a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard. someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon. most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. when Michaelis’s testimony brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade. but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. she convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. i found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. from the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to west egg village. every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. she called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. she and Tom had gone away early tuesday. she and Tom had gone away early tuesday. Meyer reassured him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—” he said. Meyer reassured him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. don’t worry. just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—” Meyer said. Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. the butler gave me his office address on Broadway. no one answered the phone, and no one answered the phone. ey were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. but they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes. his protest continued in my brain: \"Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.\" the butler asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. the butler's request seemed superfluous when I wreaked a wreak. neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. when the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between me and Gatsby. this has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me. such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business. Meyer Wolfshiem and then hasty addenda beneath: let me know about funeral etc do not know his family at all. when the phone rang I thought this would be Daisy's funeral. a man's voice came through as a man's voice, very thin and far away. \"this is Slagle speaking... isn’t it? Get my wire?\" \"Young Parke’s in trouble,\" he said rapidly. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. it said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came. it was Gatsby’s father very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty getting off his coat. the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand from his trembling hand. \"it was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away,\" he said. \"he must have been mad,\" he said. \"well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy? 'i took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall. he opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly. death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise. when he looked around him for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. \"Jimmy always liked it better down East,\" he shook his head. \"he had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of a lot of things,\" he said. \"if he’d of lived, he’d of helped build up the country,\" he said. he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed. \"this is Mr. Carraway,\" he said. \"Oh!\" he sounded relieved. \"this is Klipspringer,\" he said. \"this is Klipspringer\" \"Oh, I will,\" he broke out hastily. \"of course you’ll be there yourself,\" he said. \"how about saying you’ll come?\" he said. the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich. the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in greenwich. if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on, it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. a gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. that was my fault, for he was the receiver. Meyer Wolfshiem was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor. the door that I pushed open was marked \"the Swastika Holding Company\" Meyer Wolfshiem was one of those who sneered most bitterly at Gatsby. an argument broke out behind a partition, and a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes. the first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle tunelessly, insid. \"I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?\" a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door. she took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up. \"you young men think you can force your way in here any time,\" she scolded. Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. first time I saw him was when he came into Winchester. he was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. ebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street asked for a job. he ate more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour. he was a fine-appealing. ring, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford, he knew I could use him good. he held up two bulbous fingers, holding up two bulbous fingers, \"always together\" ring, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. the hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. \"there’s nothing to get mixed up in,\" he said after a moment. when a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. when a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. \"are you a college man?\" he said. nquired suddenly and shook my hand. he suggested a \"gonnegtion\" but he only nodded and shook my hand. the sky had turned dark and I got back to his office in a drizzle. his pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing. he took out his wallet with trembling fingers. he pointed out evy evy. ery detail to me eagerly. \"Look there!\" and then sought admiration from my eyes. he had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself. hopalong Cassidy returned a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. he was reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly. he returned the wallet and pulled it from his pocket. on the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September 12,

old man. otice what he’s got about improving his mind? he told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it. he was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. the minister looked several times at his watch, so I took him aside. he asked him to wait for half an hour, but it wasn't any use. he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. the procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate. a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from west egg. owl-eyed glasses were found marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before. the rain pounded through the gates into the cemetery. he had never seen him since then. the owl was unrolled from Gatsby's grave. he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from the grave. he was already too far away, and I could only remember without resentment. he took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in. \"the poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said. he took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in. one of my most vivid memories is of coming back from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few friends already caught up into their holiday gaieties. miss This-or-Thats'? the Schultzes'? and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved

for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line. obliging and indifferent sea

the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. when she finished she told me that she was engaged to another man. a minute ago I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake. then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye. \"you threw me over on the telephone,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\" \"you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\" \"it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess,\" she said. \"i’m five years too old to lie to

says. \"you're crazy, Nick,\" he says. \"he came to the door w/ w/ w/ w/ w/ w/ w/. hile we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in, he tried to force his way

into the store to buy a pearl necklace, or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons,rid of my provincial squeamishness forever. one of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside. perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident. one night I heard a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. but I didn't investigate. it was a final guest of a gleaming, dazzling party. obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight. on the white steps an obscene word stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly. the inessential houses began to melt away as the moon rose higher. as the

house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams. for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired. istory has something commensurate to his capacity for wonder. he had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so
