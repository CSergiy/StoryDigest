## About
**StoryDigest** is an exploration to optimize novel summaries aiming to ascertain the ideal summary length that preserves a story's essence while enhancing reader comprehension. Utilizing advanced NLP techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs), this project seeks to:

1. **Summarization Experimentation**: Systematically summarize novels at varying lengths to investigate the impact on narrative understanding.
2. **Automated Evaluation**: Deploy machine learning models to assess summary effectiveness, focusing on preserving critical plot points and overall story arc.

### Project Objective
To determine how to optimally summarize novels to ensure readers grasp the majority of a story, enhancing the learning and reading experience in educational settings and beyond.

## Prerequisites
If you wish to go through the code, ensure you have Python installed on your machine and the following packages for running the project scripts:

```
pip install transformers requests numpy pandas scipy sklearn
```

## Methodology
The project methodology encompasses:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering novels from public domain sources like Project Gutenberg.
- **Summarization Techniques**: Applying different LLMs to summarize texts at various granularities.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilizing NLP evaluation metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and custom coherence measures to assess summary quality.
- **Model Development**: Constructing a model to predict the effectiveness of summaries in conveying the story's essence.

## Results
*As the StoryDigest project is in its active stages of development and experimentation, this section is poised to evolve. Upon completion of the summarization experiments, it will be updated to showcase our findings, including insights into the optimal summary lengths and styles that best support narrative comprehension and retention. We are committed to sharing our discoveries and breakthroughs in enhancing the understanding of complex narratives through optimized summarization.*
